# EnergizeOS‚Ñ¢ Project Document Portal

This repository powers the public-facing project document portal hosted at  
üëâ [https://projects.energizeos.com](https://projects.energizeos.com)

The portal automatically lists and serves project-related files directly from a shared Google Drive folder. It is built with **GitHub Pages + Google Drive API**, so there is no backend server required.
